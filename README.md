# the-windows-footprint-destroyer-Batch-Tool Version 1.0 Beta
this tool in batch is able to erase the logs that our presence leaves when getting a meterpreter. it works similar to clearev but in a manual way









This little tool could help in these situations as pentester:

*delete the logs left by the sessions of meterpreter or in an intrusion
*disable the Windows UAC security mechanism
*disable the windows firewall to be able to play more with our meterpreter session
*check if the windows logs were actually deleted from the victim system that we attacked
*install a backdoor in silent windows registry against system shutdowns
(IMPORTANT: we must use it together with the netcat attachment for this option to work, see the demonstration images below)
